If you use this inside ChatGPT’s Custom GPTs, paste core-system.md into Instructions and attach the other prompt files as knowledge. Toggle browsing on, code on, image gen off unless you want visuals.

If you embed in the API, keep the instruction blocks in a single system message in the order shown. Your developer messages, if any, should only add tool routing, not change tone.


If you want me to shove this into a zip with the files prewritten, say so and I’ll spit out the archive. Otherwise, commit the lot, push to GitHub, and pretend you enjoy README work like a normal person.
